#Book Contents
guide.vanilla.entry.intro=Welcome to this magical world of @BLD@Minecraft!@END@ This book contains a mountain full of information, tips and lores that will fully educate players like you on the realms of Minecraft. This book will guide you in every step of the way throughout vanilla Minecraft making sure that you don't trip or stumble as you keep progressing to greater lengths! These first entries are to help beginners situate themselves into an unfamiliar world and to guide them from the start, so they won't contain as much information as some of the other chapters of this book. If you're more advanced, I'd suggest taking a look at the other chapters! So what are you waiting for? Open up one of these pages and engulf yourself into the wealth of information presented to you in this book thanks to Guide-API!               --Foreword: This book requires you to have access to crafting recipes within the game. We recommend either installing CodeChickenCore and NotEnoughItems by Chickenbones, or using the Minecraft Wiki.
guide.vanilla.entry.gettingStarted=Let's get started! (This book automatically assumes that you know the controls) First view your surroundings and analyze what resources you have at your disposal. Make careful note of trees, caves, mountains, and other geologic features. You can check what @GRN@Biome@END@ you're in by pressing F3 and then you can check the specifics of that biome inside of this book. First off, go punch some trees and gather some @BLU@Wood@END@. Wood is an essential resource that you'll be using for plenty of items and blocks. But for now, you can simply turn it into wooden planks by tossing it into your player's crafting square in your inventory yielding 4 wooden planks. You can then use these planks to make items such as sticks and the most important: the @BLU@Crafting Table@END@. (Can be any type of wood)
guide.vanilla.entry.gettingStarted2=You can now use the crafting bench (place in world and right-click) to craft more complex items. I'd suggest crafting some sticks and some more planks to create wooden tools such as axes and pickaxes. You can use these tools to harvest their respective materials much more quickly (i.e. axes will harvest wood more quickly) Gather more wood and search for stone or dig down a few layers through dirt. Start by mining the @BLU@Stone@END@ with a @BLU@Wooden Pickaxe@END@. After you've gathered enough @BLU@Cobblestone@END@, you can craft a @BLU@Furnace@END@; another key block in Minecraft. Another block that you might want to consider mining is @BLU@Coal Ore@END@. Coal Ore is found almost anywhere in the ground with a distinct blackish look. Mining it will yield @BLU@Coal@END@ which can be used to fuel furnaces. You can also use these to craft @BLU@Torches@END@ with sticks, an essential light source. If you're running out of inventory space, you can make a @BLU@Chest@END@ to store things in. You can also place two chests next to another to get a double chest for even more storage space.
guide.vanilla.entry.stoneAge=Once you have gathered up more stone, you can craft yourself some stone tools! Stone tools are quicker and can harvest more blocks than wooden tools can such as @BLU@Iron Ore@END@. Start off by making a @BLU@Stone Pickaxe@END@ and a @BLU@Stone Sword@END@. You might want to take shelter as it becomes night; if you're not playing on @GLD@Peaceful Mode@END@, then @RED@Mobs@END@ will spawn. Mobs are hostile creatures that will attack you if they see you and spawn in dark places, namely the @AQA@Overworld@END@ during nighttime. If you do run into these mobs, (@RED@Zombies@END@, @RED@Skeletons@END@, @RED@Spiders@END@) you can either try to fight them with your sword or run and take shelter. @UND@Remember!@END@ Mobs spawn in dark places so it is important to light up any place you don't want mobs spawning in with torches! However a good thing to also note is that mobs will burn in direct sunlight meaning during daytime, they will begin to burn up making it safe to roam the Overworld again.
guide.vanilla.entry.gettingHungry=Spot that bar next to your health bar with a bunch of drumsticks? That is your hunger bar! If it's at its highest, you'll slowly regain lost health. If it's depleted to a certain point, you won't be able to run, if it's down all the way, better hope you have something to chow down on otherwise you'll be starving to death! Intensive activities such as running, jumping, and swinging around a sword rapidly will cause it to go down quicker; the best way to replenish it is by eating food. Food comes in many shapes and sizes with the most basic coming from nearby animals such as pigs, cows, and chickens. Killing them gives you @BLU@Raw Meat@END@ which you can then smelt to turn into @BLU@Cooked Meat@END@.
guide.vanilla.entry.gettingHungry2=Don't want to kill animals? Well, me neither as they could come in use some other time. "But they're the only food source in Minecraft!" you say, but there are alternatives such as the longer but renewable @GRN@Farming@END@. You need a hoe (any type will do) and dirt. Till the dirt by right-clicking it with the hoe, and make sure that the soil is next to some water. You can then plant seeds onto the land and wait as it gradually sprouts into @BLU@Wheat@END@. Wheat can then be turned into bread which can then be eaten. Other crops you might encounter include: @BLU@Carrots@END@, and @BLU@Potatoes@END@.
guide.vanilla.entry.buildAHouse=Tired of living in caves waiting for the sun to rise up and burn the evil creatures that lurk in the night? You can get rid of that by constructing your first shelter! First plot an area of land and clear it if necessary. Make sure you have enough materials and make it as secure as possible to prevent mobs from entering. Making a door doesn't sound like too bad of an idea.
guide.vanilla.entry.buildAHouse2=Make sure to light up the insides to prevent mobs from spawning! Aside from doors, there are also trapdoors if you're living in a bunker too! But what does making a secure shelter mean? As long as mobs do not have an access to you while you're in it, and they can't spawn, everything is good. If you'd like some transparency to see what's going on outside, I suggest using @BLU@Glass@END@ which serves as a block, but can be seen through. Design is all up to you! Be sure that you have a clear idea of where it is located in the world so you can go back to it.
guide.vanilla.entry.buildAHouse3=Another important block that is advisable to have would be the @BLU@Bed@END@. The Bed is made up of 3 blocks of @BLU@Wool@END@ and 3 @BLU@Wooden Planks@END@ so you'll either need to shear/kill some sheep to obtain wool. If you use the bed during night hours (provided that there aren't mobs nearby), you'll fall asleep and day time will arise with you! An easy solution to getting around night! (Can be any color wool/wood)
guide.vanilla.entry.ironAge=Now, stone is all good and everything, but it's not good enough. To upgrade your stone tools, you need to obtain @BLU@Iron Ore@END@. You can find some by going deeper and deeper into the ground when you mine for resources. Once you have a decent amount of it, you can then throw it into the @BLU@Furnace@END@ and smelt it into @BLU@Iron Ingots@END@. These will be the very beginning of The Iron Age!!! To use these ingots, you can craft normal tools with them (i.e. @BLU@Iron Pickaxe@END@, @BLU@Iron Sword@END@) that can mine more things than stone, and much quicker as well.
guide.vanilla.entry.ironAge2=Iron can also be used to make a variety of other useful blocks and items such as @BLU@Armor@END@ which protects you from a certain degree of damage, and @BLU@Hoppers@END@ or @BLU@Minecarts@END@ which are useful for automation and transport. You can also make @BLU@Iron Doors@END@ which are stronger variants of @BLU@Wooden Doors@END@ but they can only be opened via a redstone signal.
guide.vanilla.entry.mining=Now that you have some sturdy iron tools and a nice house (hopefully), you'll have to start mining deep into the ground to progress any further. Mining can be very tedious; even more so if you don't know what you're looking for. First, you should understand what the world looks like: there is the surface, a thin 7 blocks or less deep full of dirt, and then stone all the way down until a very thin layer of bedrock at the bottom. @BLU@Coal@END@ and @BLU@Iron@END@ are found spread out in the stone, @BLU@Gold@END@, @BLU@Lapis@END@, are found more towards the bottom (about 30 blocks up from bedrock) and @BLU@Redstone@END@ and @BLU@Diamonds@END@ are found nearer towards the bottom (about 10 blocks up from bedrock). Most players aim there mining efforts towards the redstone/diamond layer or the gold/lapis layer. But beware new miners! Certain dangers await the unwary. For instance, you may have noticed that caves exist in every height and have precious ores lining their walls; but they are dark rendering them vulnerable to mobs spawning. The most dangerous however, is @BLU@Lava@END@. Lava will almost instantaneously burn up a player and everything that they are carrying when in contact. A slight touch will leave the player burning and it is most advised to run right into water. Lava pools are more frequent near the redstone/diamond layers. Be wary not to run into them and especially, @BLD@@UND@DO NOT DIG STRAIGHT DOWN!!!@END@@END@
guide.vanilla.entry.usefulItems=You're pretty much set for now but you'd like some extra things to help you on your journey. Some items that you might want to consider taking a look at are the @BLU@Compass@END@, @BLU@Clock@END@, and the @BLU@Map@END@. The compass is an item that points to wherever you last slept in a @BLU@Bed@END@. Useful for finding your way home! The clock displays what the current time of day is using the sun and moon as measures, and the map will map a large area depending on where you're standing. Neat huh?
guide.vanilla.entry.endlessPossibilities=And now, if you have survived up to this point, congratulations! You now know the basic elements of Minecraft and how to play and survive. But still, you have only glimpsed of the endless possibilities that await you as you venture out into the world to explore the many wonders of Minecraft. You are now capable of diving into the many other chapters inside of this book and utilizing that information for your own good! Now go forth and let your creativity guide your path onwards!

guide.vanilla.entry.fluids=@BLU@Water@END@ and @BLU@Lava@END@ both have something in common, that is, they are both liquids! Liquids can be stored in an item form, via the @BLU@Bucket@END@. Simply right-click the bucket onto a source block and it will go right into the bucket, ready to be placed again! The only other thing you can use buckets for is milking @DGRN@Cows@END@. Another item that is quite useful is the @BLU@Boat@END@. The boat can travel across large bodies of water in an instant compared to swimming across. However, if it hits a solid object too quickly, then the boat will break.
guide.vanilla.entry.boom=Mining....mining....oh so boring. LET'S HAVE SOME FUN SHALL WE??!!! You can make the explosive @BLU@TNT@END@ using @BLU@Gunpowder@END@ and @BLU@Sand@END@! TNT will be primed if a redstone signal is applied to it and once it goes off, you better be far away from it otherwise you might get caught in the explosion! Even though it is certainly fun to play with and quite useful for clearing large areas, TNT is a poor mining choice due to the not-exactly-100% drop rate of what it destroys. Keep that in mind when you attempt to line a mineshaft with it. You can also add TNT to a @BLU@Minecart@END@ to create a @BLU@TNT Minecart@END@: mobile demolition!
guide.vanilla.entry.diamondAndObsidian=@BLU@Diamonds@END@. The single word is the most prized and coveted object in vanilla Minecraft; what all players strive for, are willing to risk everything they have for it, and the rarest gem in the game. But what is so great about these crystals? It can be made into tools and armor just like iron can, and is the toughest of it's kind making your tools extremely fast, and taking a considerably longer time to wear out. Not only that, but the @BLU@Diamond Pickaxe@END@ can also mine the most hardest (obtainable) block in Minecraft: @BLU@Obsidian@END@. Even though this material takes ages even with the diamond pickaxe to mine, it is extremely hard, and resistant to explosions. It is formed when @BLU@Water@END@ comes into contact with a @BLU@Lava@END@ source block. (Hint: use @BLU@Buckets@END@) Obsidian can also be used to make a @DRED@Nether Portal@END@. You will soon see that these portals to another dimension can bring fortune and adventure or loss.
guide.vanilla.entry.enchanting=What can you do with these newfound diamonds and obsidian? Well you can also use them to @LPRP@Enchant@END@ items. Enchanting items puts an enchantment onto an item; the item will then have the effect of that enchantment. Enchantments also have @LPRP@Levels@END@. These levels dictate how strong the enchantment is. Start off by making an @BLU@Enchanting Table@END@. These tables once clicked, allows you to convert your @GRN@EXP@END@ into enchantments that can either be applied to items or books. However, on it's own, the Enchanting Table cannot enchant to such high levels; instead it needs nearby @BLU@Bookshelves@END@ (1 block away) to increase the amount of levels that it can handle. Only 15 bookshelves are needed to let the table reach level 30 enchantments which are the highest, and most potent. Despite how many levels you have and bookshelves, enchanting is still a completely random selection and enchants cannot be taken off of items. However, one strategy for enchanting is to enchant books and then later applying the enchanted books onto items using an @BLU@Anvil@END@. Although this requires more @GRN@EXP@END@, it is a fail-proof method to avoid wasting items on "useless" enchants.
guide.vanilla.entry.nether=So you've heard about this scary dimension called, '@DRED@The Nether@END@', and you wonder, how bad can it really be? Well, it's time to find out yourself! First off, you need to create a @DRED@Nether Portal@END@ using @BLU@Obsidian@END@ in the pattern shown on the next page.
guide.vanilla.entry.nether2=Step right in but make sure you: have weapons (a bow would be nice), have armor, have food, cobblestone (or other bocks), and Flint And Steel. Inside @DRED@The Nether@END@, you'll find a world dominated by lava and fire with @RED@Zombie Pigmen@END@ roaming around everywhere. What is there in The Nether? The red block that populates it is called @BLU@Netherrack@END@ and sustains @BLU@Fire@END@ forever. If you find some brown @BLU@Soul Sand@END@, it will slow down anything on it and is also the only material that @BLU@Nether Wart@END@ grows on. There are also bright yellow clusters clinging to the ceiling. They are made up of @BLU@Glowstone@END@ which is a key @LPRP@Potion@END@ ingredient and a nice decoration block. Occasionally spotting the surface of the Nether are veins of @BLU@Nether Quartz@END@ However, if you're lucky, you'll be able to spot a giant looming fortress in the middle of a lava ocean. These @RED@Nether Fortresses@END@ are vast, and contain treasures such as @BLU@Dungeon Chests@END@ and @RED@Blaze Spawners@END@. The 'Forts' are also the only known sources of @BLU@Nether Wart@END@. They are also highly dangerous and we recommend staying away from these unless you are well equipped. Keynote: @BLU@Water@END@ does not exist in the Nether nor can it. It will evaporate due to the extreme heat.
guide.vanilla.entry.potionMaster=Once you've collected a couple of @BLU@Nether Warts@END@ and @BLU@Blaze Rods@END@ from the @DRED@Nether@END@, you can use them to make the @BLU@Brewing Stand@END@ and start your journey as a Potion Brewer. To start off, make a @BLU@Brewing Stand@END@.
guide.vanilla.entry.potionMaster2=Now you can make some @BLU@Empty Bottles@END@ and fill them up with @BLU@Water@END@ by right-clicking them on water source blocks. Then you can put them into the Brewing Stand and put some @LPRP@Potion@END@ ingredients to brew different kinds of @LPRP@Potions@END@. To start off, place nether wart with 1 (or more) water bottles into the brewing stand. Brewing takes a short period of time, but once you're done, you should receive @BLU@Awkward Potions@END@ with no effects. You can then add one of these items: @BLU@Magma Cream, Sugar, Glistering Melon, Spider Eye, Ghast Tear, Blaze Powder, Fermented Spider Eye, Golden Carrot@END@ and @BLU@Pufferfish@END@ to get, @LPRP@Fire Resistance, Speed, Instant Health, Poison, Regeneration, Strength, Weakness, Night Vision@END@, and @LPRP@Water Breathing@END@ respectively. You can then add some modifiers to these potions using these items: @BLU@Redstone, Glowstone Dust, Gunpowder@END@, and @BLU@Fermented Spider Eye@END@. These do: increases duration, increases potency, turns into a splash, and corrupts/reverses the effect respectively. More information found in the Statistical Information chapters.
guide.vanilla.entry.cartsAndRails=Utilizing your @BLU@Iron@END@ and @BLU@Sticks@END@, you can make @BLU@Rails@END@ and @BLU@Minecarts@END@. Minecarts are basic transportation vehicles that travel on rails. Simply right-click a minecart onto a rail and you can then right click the minecart to ride it. Of course, it won't move without being pushed somehow so you can also use a bit of @BLU@Gold@END@ and @BLU@Redstone@END@ to make @BLU@Powered Rails@END@. If you apply a redstone signal to a powered rail, any minecart traveling over it will be sped up considerably shooting it across a good amount of track.
guide.vanilla.entry.cartsAndRails2=There are also other carts and rails that you can use such as the @BLU@Chest Minecart@END@ which is basically what the name says: a @BLU@Chest@END@ in a @BLU@Minecart@END@. The @BLU@Furnace Minecart@END@ on the other hand, is a @BLU@Furnace@END@ on a minecart, but it also pushes other carts when it is fueled. Other rails include @BLU@Activator Rails@END@ which (if it has a redstone signal applied to it) will light up any @BLU@TNT Minecarts@END@ that pass over it. There is also the @BLU@Detector Rail@END@ which emits a redstone signal if a minecart passes over it. Useful for redstone contraptions.
guide.vanilla.entry.decor=Plain old blocks get pretty dull pretty quickly just like the use of 'pretty' in this not-so-pretty-sentence. That's why here are other alternatives such as @BLU@Stairs@END@ which are blocks that can elevate from a lower elevation to a higher, @BLU@Slabs@END@ which do the same (over more of a distance though), and other useful blocks such as @BLU@Iron Bars@END@, @BLU@Glass Panes@END@, and @BLU@Fences@END@. Iron bars and glass panes are blocks that have a tight bounding box and give for a cool effect on different builds/buildings. Fences are blocks that cannot be jumped over (@BLU@Walls@END@ are equivalent to fences). @BLU@Fence Gates@END@ are fences that when you right click them, open up to allow passage through. Pretty nifty for farms and such. Another neat block is the @BLU@Ladder@END@ which allows for vertical escalation; the @BLU@Carpet@END@ which is a small decoration for floors using @BLU@Wool@END@ (Can be any type of wool).
guide.vanilla.entry.colorsEverywhere=Colors! Colors! Even more colors! Only thing that's missing is colored squids... Anyways, Minecraft has a variety of colors to pick and choose from, and many blocks that can be dyed with those colors. Minecraft has 16 colors: White, Orange, Magenta, Light Blue, Yellow, Lime, Pink, Gray, Light Gray, Cyan, Purple, Blue, Brown, Green, Red, and Black. They are known as the Minecraft colors. What can you do with this rainbow? Well, you can dye these blocks: @BLU@Wool, Carpet, Hardened Clay, Glass@END@, and @BLU@Glass Panes@END@. Each color has their own dye that you can then use to dye the blocks with. Fun rainbow pictures!
guide.vanilla.entry.fireworks=Fireworks are a really cool system and can be used to add more flare to your world. You can customize them in almost any way you want such as their shape, colors, trails, length, and radius! To start with, you'll need @BLU@Gunpowder@END@ and @BLU@Dyes@END@. You can also set the shape to something else when you put the gunpowder and dye into a crafting table along with any other modifiers. You'll get a @BLU@Firework Star@END@ which can be then used to make a firework using @BLU@Paper@END@ and gunpowder. Once place, these fireworks will shoot up into the sky and explode into a flurry of colors!
guide.vanilla.entry.snow0=Cold things are pretty chill, no matter where they are and they're also neat in their functionality like @BLU@Snowballs@END@! You can get snowballs by shoveling up some @BLU@Snow@END@ on the ground in cold @GRN@Biomes@END@ which can then be used to throw at things or turned into @BLU@Snow Blocks@END@. Snow blocks are basically compacted snow, once they're shoveled, they'll yield the same amount of snowballs used to make them however, if you place two on top of each other, and a @BLU@Pumpkin@END@ on top of that, a @GRN@Snow Golem@END@ will spawn! (Gotta love them) @BLU@Ice@END@ can be found in cold biomes when @BLU@Water@END@ freezes. When broken, it will create a water source block where it is so in order to harvest it, you'll need the enchantment @LPRP@Silk Touch@END@ on your pick. Ice will melt only if there is heat next to it (i.e. @BLU@Torches@END@). Ice is also very slippery (duh) and can be used for a variety of transport systems. There is a non-melting ice called @BLU@Packed Ice@END@ found in super cold biomes.
guide.vanilla.entry.snow1=Cold things are pretty chill right Freeze? No matter where they are, they're neat in their functionality like @BLU@Snowballs@END@! You can get snowballs by shoveling up some @BLU@Snow@END@ on the ground in cold @GRN@Biomes@END@ which can then be used to throw at things or turned into @BLU@Snow Blocks@END@. Snow blocks are basically compacted snow, once they're shoveled, they'll yield the same amount of snowballs used to make them however, if you place two on top of each other, and a @BLU@Pumpkin@END@ on top of that, a @GRN@Snow Golem@END@ will spawn! (Gotta love them) @BLU@Ice@END@ can be found in cold biomes when @BLU@Water@END@ freezes. When broken, it will create a water source block where it is so in order to harvest it, you'll need the enchantment @LPRP@Silk Touch@END@ on your pick. Ice will melt only if there is heat next to it (i.e. @BLU@Torches@END@). Ice is also very slippery (duh) and can be used for a variety of transport systems. There is a non-melting ice called @BLU@Packed Ice@END@ found in super cold biomes. Too bad there aren't any Freeze Guns...
guide.vanilla.entry.snow2=C-C-C-Cold things are pretty ch-ch-ch-chill, and they're neat in their functionality like @BLU@Snowballs@END@! You can get snowballs by shoveling up some @BLU@Snow@END@ on the ground in cold @GRN@Biomes@END@ which can then be used to throw at things or turned into @BLU@Snow Blocks@END@. S-S-S-Snow blocks are basically compacted snow, once they're shoveled, they'll yield the same amount of snowballs used to make them however, if you place two on top of each other, and a @BLU@Pumpkin@END@ on top of that, a @GRN@Snow Golem@END@ will spawn! (Gotta love them) @BLU@Ice@END@ can be found in cold biomes when @BLU@Water@END@ f-f-f-freezes. When broken, it will create a water source block where it is so in order to harvest it, you'll need the enchantment @LPRP@Silk Touch@END@ on your pick. Ice will melt only if there is heat next to it (i.e. @BLU@Torches@END@). Ice is also very s-s-s-slippery (duh) and can be used for a variety of transport systems. There is a non-melting ice called @BLU@Packed Ice@END@ found in super cold biomes.
guide.vanilla.entry.enderThings=Now, if you've spotted a couple of @GLD@Endermen@END@ around the world, you might know that they sometimes drop @BLU@Ender Pearls@END@. These uncommon items themselves can be used to teleport. Simply throw it at the desired location and you'll be there in a blink. You'll take some damage of course, but instant travel! Apart from teleporting, you can also use them to create @BLU@Eyes Of Ender@END@ and @BLU@Ender Chests@END@. The eyes of ender are used to locate Strongholds so it's a good idea to stock up on a few just for that purpose. It's also used for gaining access to the @BLD@@UND@@PRP@End@END@. Ender chests on the other hand, are extremely useful and convenient. Simply place one down in the world and put whatever you want. Then, whenever you need that item, you can simply put down another ender chest anywhere you'd like, and take it out. Kind of like an extra inventory. Downside is, they break down into @BLU@Obsidian@END@ when you harvest them unless you have @LPRP@Silk Touch@END@ on your pick. Otherwise you'll have to recraft the ender chest.
guide.vanilla.entry.wither=If you've been to your fare share of @DRED@Nether Fortresses@END@, you might've encountered some black skeletons called @RED@Wither Skeletons@END@. These are nasty creatures that upon contact, cause it's victims to slowly wither away. It's advisable to take them out by means of arrows, and once they die, they have a REALLY SMALL chance of dropping their skulls, known as @BLU@Wither Skulls@END@. These skulls are even harder to obtain then diamonds and one will have to grind for quite awhile before gathering 3 of them (best to have @LPRP@Looting@END@ on your sword/bow). Why 3? The only use for these skulls, is spawning the @DGRY@Wither@END@. The @DGRY@Wither@END@ is a nasty boss that can be spawned by making a structure like this:
guide.vanilla.entry.wither2=Now hold on there before you spawn it, there are some things that you should keep note of. First, don't spawn it anywhere near anything important like your base; there will be lots of explosions! Secondly, make sure as usual that you have enchanted armor, bow, and sword. You will need potions! Lastly, when you spawn it, there will be a brief period of time where it sits there regenerating health; you can't do anything to it so don't bother, but once it's done, it will explode in a decent radius. Get prepared to fight for your life, and have a good amount of @LPRP@Regeneration@END@! If you do manage to kill the @DGRY@Wither@END@, then you'll obtain one of the most rarest items in game, the @BLU@Nether Star@END@. As you'll see in the next entry, the nether star can be used for a very powerful block called the @BLU@Beacon@END@.
guide.vanilla.entry.beacon=This powerful @BLU@Nether Star@END@ is useless on its own. Instead, you have to craft it into a @BLU@Beacon@END@ for it to have any use. But even then, it's still useless. So how do you make this darn thing work? Well first, hope that you've been hoarding resources namely, @BLU@Iron@RST@, Gold@RST@, Diamonds@RST@, @RST@or Emeralds@END@. To construct a functional beacon, you'll have to understand that the beacon has 5 tiers. Each tier is built using blocks of resources. The following pages will show you how to construct such a beacon.
guide.vanilla.entry.beacon2=As you can see, you'll need quite a large amount of resources to construct a beacon. But what exactly does it do? The more tiers you unlock, the more the beacon can grant you in terms of @LPRP@Potion Buffs@END@. These buffs range from @LPRP@Speed@END@, to @LPRP@Regeneration@END@. To have the beacon apply the selected effect, simply select the effect and insert one of the 4 payment items into the slot, and press the green check button. The beacon will consistently grant the buff to you as long as you're in a (20, 30, 40, 50) block radius (respective to beacon tier), and the beacon's structure is intact.
guide.vanilla.entry.theEnd="The End? Wha..? No one told me there was an end to Minecraft!" Well, there is and there isn't. @PRP@The End@END@ is a dimension where @PRP@Endermen@PRP@ roam freely and the @PRP@@UND@@BLD@THE ENDER DRAGON RULES@END@. Yes you heard me right, an @PRP@@UND@@BLD@ENDER DRAGON@END@. Oh yeah, Minecraft also doesn't have an end. But back to @PRP@The End@END@... To get to this wonderful dimension, you need to locate a @GRY@Stronghold@END@ (more in The World Around You) Upon location, the player must then find a room nicknamed "The Portal Room" where there will be a @RED@Silverfish Spawner@END@ and a staircase leading to a 3x3 structure with blocks surrounding it. These blocks are @BLU@End Portal@END@ blocks. Some may have an eye in them while some don't.
guide.vanilla.entry.theEnd2=Wait, wait, wait! Before you jump into @PRP@The End@END@ to your end, make sure you have: good armor, good tools (all have to be enchanted!!!) YOU NEED A BOW WITH ARROWS, a good supply of blocks, a good supply of food, and preferably an @PRP@Ender Chest@END@ with extra supplies in it potions, food, etc., and before you jump in, I suggest going onto YouTube and taking a look at videos that deal with fighting the @PRP@Ender Dragon@END@. Once you have a strategy planned out, you can now jump in and once you're through, you'll be on an @BLU@Obsidian@END@ platform some distance away from the mainland. Block your way across and get prepared to fight for your life! @RED@@BLD@@UND@WARNING!!! ONCE YOU GO IN, THERE IS NO WAY OUT UNTIL YOU BEAT THE @PRP@ENDER DRAGON@END@

guide.vanilla.entry.miningTools=Tools are items in Minecraft that have a specific purpose to aid the player, and they usually have a durability. All main tools in Minecraft can be made out of these materials: @BLU@Wood, Stone, Gold, Iron@END@, and @BLU@Diamond@END@. The better the material, the better the tool. There are 3 basic "mining" tools in Minecraft that each harvest certain types of blocks quicker than by hand. First we're going to introduce a tool that you're already familiar with, the @BLU@Pickaxe@END@. The pickaxe can mine anything that is a @BLU@Stone@END@ or @BLU@Metal@END@ blocks and most stone/metal blocks require a pickaxe to harvest. The @BLU@Axe@END@ is a tool that harvests anything @BLU@Wooden@END@ and a couple of other plants (@BLU@Melons, Pumpkins, Mushrooms@END@). Finally, the @BLU@Shovel@END@ harvests @BLU@Dirt, Grass, Gravel@END@, and @BLU@Sand@END@ quickly. Shoveling gravel gives you a percent chance for it to drop @BLU@Flint@END@ instead of gravel. The following @LPRP@Enchants@LPRP@ can be put onto the 3 tools: @LPRP@Efficiency@END@, which increases the harvest speed of the tool; @LPRP@Unbreaking@END@ which gives a percent chance for the tool not to use durability when it is used; @LPRP@Fortune@END@, which when a certain block is mined, gives more of the items that it drops (Example: If you have Fortune on a pickaxe and you mine @BLU@Ore@END@ that drops something other than itself (like diamonds), it will yield more than it previously did); and @LPRP@Silk Touch@END@ which keeps whatever is mined in its original form (Example: If a pickaxe is enchanted with Silk Touch and you mine stone with it, it will drop stone instead of @BLU@Cobblestone@END@ (Does not work on spawners!)) Note: Silk Touch and Fortune cannot be put on a single tool at the same time. One other tool (not a mining tool) is the @BLU@Hoe@END@. The enchantment @LPRP@Sharpness@END@ can also be applied to axes increasing the damage that is inflicted against mobs when you attack them with it. The hoe is used ONLY to till soil, so the only enchants that will work on it is Unbreaking.
guide.vanilla.entry.swords=Swords are another tool (made of @BLU@Wood, Stone, Gold, Iron@END@, and @BLU@Diamonds@END@) as well and as their name implies, they are used to deal damage to mobs. The better the material, more damage will be done. Swords can also harvest a few blocks quicker such as: @BLU@Cobwebs, Vines, Leaves, Melons@END@, and certain types of plants. They can be enchanted with a variety of @LPRP@Enchantments@END@ such as: @LPRP@Unbreaking@END@, as mentioned earlier, reduces the chance of the tool being damaged upon usage; @LPRP@Sharpness@END@, which increases the amount of damage that the sword deals; @LPRP@Smite@END@ which deals much more damage to @RED@Undead Mobs@END@ and the normal damage of the sword to other mobs; @LPRP@Bane Of Arthropods@END@, which is similar to Smite, only it affects @RED@Spiders, Cave Spiders@END@, and @RED@Silverfish@END@ while casting the @PRP@Slowness@END@ (Level 4) effect to them; @LPRP@Knockback@END@, which increases the distance that the entity is knocked back by; @LPRP@Fire Aspect@END@, which lights the mob on fire for a short time period; and @LPRP@Looting@END@, which is the Fortune equivalent of "mining" tools. Looting gives a higher drop rate of items from a mob, and more of it. <-- I recommend using it to obtain rare items such as @BLU@Wither Skulls@END@! Note: Out of the 3 damage enchantments (Sharpness, Smite, Bane Of Arthropods), a sword can only have 1.
guide.vanilla.entry.fireFishing=Ok, there's not actually any fire fishing in Minecraft, but it'd be cool right? Instead, there's the @BLU@Flint And Steel@END@ and @BLU@Fishing Rod@END@. The flint and steel is a tool that is used to spark @BLU@Fire@END@. This fire will burn all @BLU@Wooden@END@ material and spread given the chance. It's also used for activating @DRED@Nether Portals@END@ and lighting @BLU@TNT@END@ without the use of redstone. Pretty useful if I may say so. The fishing rod on the other hand is used to, well, fish. Right-click casts a bobber and you need to cast it into @BLU@Water@END@. Wait a few moments, and if you're lucky, you'll see bubbles and your bobber go down. Right then and there is when you should right-click, and you should obtain some @BLU@Fish@END@! You may also end up fishing some odd items that are labeled as "treasure" items if it's good, or "junk" items if it's bad. Flint and steel and fishing rods can be both enchanted with @LPRP@Unbreaking@END@ but the fishing rod also has 2 additional enchantments that can be applied: @LPRP@Luck Of The Sea@END@, which decreases the chance of catching "junk", and increases the chances of catching "treasure"; and @LPRP@Luck@END@, which decreases the amount of time before a fish bites the hook. Fishing rods can also be used to "hook" onto mobs and "reel" them in. Simply hit them with the hook when you cast it, and right-click to bring it towards you.
guide.vanilla.entry.bowsAndArrows=Ranged weaponry anyone? @BLU@Bows@END@ are weapons that shoot @BLU@Arrows@END@ in the direction pointed in. Arrows can hurt if you know how to properly use them. You have to hold right-click the bow to nock the arrow. Once the bow animation stops pulling, you know that you've reached maximum strength and are ready to fire. If you release halfway through, your arrow will be very weak. Once you're fully charged, you can aim at a target and release. The bow shoots in a parabolic arc; this means that the arrow will gradually go down to the ground as it gets farther and farther away from the shooter. Arrows themselves, once shot, have a chance of dealing extra damage once it hits a target: this is called a Critical. However, there are many @LPRP@Enchantments@END@ that can make your bow, MUCH, MUCH more deadly such as: @LPRP@Unbreaking@END@ which you should know by now reduces the chance that the item is damaged when you use it; @LPRP@Power@END@ which is the Sharpness equivalent of swords (increases the damage that the arrow inflicts); @LPRP@Punch@END@, which is the Knockback equivalent of swords; @LPRP@Flame@END@, which is the Fire Aspect equivalent of swords; and @LPRP@Infinity@END@ which makes it so that you only need 1 arrow in your inventory to shoot as many as you want. Bows are highly recommended against @RED@Bosses@END@ such as the @DGRY@Wither@END@ or the @BLD@@PRP@Ender Dragon@END@ since bows inflict the most damage from afar.
guide.vanilla.entry.shears=@BLU@Shears@END@ are tools that can be used to shear @GRN@Sheep@END@ to obtain @BLU@Wool@END@. This process is harmless, and provided that the sheep has grass to graze on, the wool will regrow. (and you get more wool, so shear sheep!) Not only that however, shears can also be used to harvest plant blocks such as: @BLU@Leaves, Vines, Cobwebs@END@, and @BLU@Tallgrass@END@. The following enchants can be put onto shears: @LPRP@Unbreaking@END@ which reduces the chance of the item being damaged when you use it; @LPRP@Efficiency@END@ which increases the speed at which it harvests blocks; and @LPRP@Silk Touch@END@ which harvests the original block (harvesting a @BLU@Grass@END@ block will yield the grass block instead of @BLU@Dirt@END@).
guide.vanilla.entry.armor=@BLU@Armor@END@ is essential to all players protecting them from all shapes of different kinds of damage. Unlike tools, armor can be made of: @BLU@Leather, Chainmail, Gold, Iron@END@, and @BLU@Diamond@END@ in order of weakest to strongest. Your current armor bar (if you have any) is displayed above your health bar. There are 4 types of armor, the @BLU@Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings@END@, and @BLU@Boots@END@. On a scale of 20, the helmet and boots both have a protection percentage of 3, the chestplate has the most with 8, and the leggings have 6. Armor can be enchanted in a large array of enchantments such as: @LPRP@Protection@END@, which increases the general amount of damage reduction; @LPRP@Fire Protection@END@, which reduces fire-based damage from @BLU@Fire, Lava@END@, and @BLU@Fire Charges@END@ (that light you on fire) from @RED@Ghasts@END@, you'll also have the burn time of being on fire reduced; @LPRP@Feather Falling@END@ (can only be applied to boots) which reduces the amount of damage taken from falling; @LPRP@Blast Protection@END@, which reduces the amount of damage taken from explosions and knockback from explosions; @LPRP@Projectile Protection@END@ which reduces the amount of damage taken from projectiles such as @BLU@Arrows@END@, @RED@Ghasts@END@, and @RED@Blazes@END@ (only reduces damage on impact; Fire Protection reduces actual burning); @LPRP@Respiration@END@ (can only be applied to helmets) which extends your underwater breathing time, time between suffocation damage, and underwater vision; @LPRP@Aqua Affinity@END@ (also can only be applied to helmets) which increases the speed at which you mine underwater; @LPRP@Thorns@END@ (enchanted on chestplate, if it's on other pieces of armor, only the "bottommost" will take into effect) which damages the entity that attacked the player; @LPRP@Unbreaking@END@ which reduces the chance that the armor is damaged by damage.
guide.vanilla.entry.carrotsOnSticks=What's a @BLU@Carrot On A Stick@END@? Odd as it may seem, it is! This weird tool is used to....ride @GRN@Pigs@END@?? Yep! Before @GRN@Horses@END@, there were pigs! Simply put a @BLU@Saddle@END@ onto a pig's back, hop onto it, and use the carrot on a stick to motivate it in the direction in which you want to travel in. Not exactly the best method of transportation, but, it works right? Like all other tools with durability, @LPRP@Unbreaking@END@ can be put onto this.
guide.vanilla.entry.fixing=All tools wear down eventually. There's no stopping it. You can try and put @LPRP@Unbreaking@END@ on them, but still, they'll eventually wear down and before you know it, you'll need a new one! Or is that right? Let me introduce you to a nifty block called the @BLU@Anvil@END@! The anvil can be used for 3 things: Repairing tools, adding @LPRP@Enchantments@END@/combining @LPRP@Enchantments@END@ onto tools, and all the while you an name them! To repair a tool, you must first place the tool in the left slot and the material that is used to make it (@BLU@Diamonds, Iron@END@, etc.) on the right. It will repair accordingly to the amount that you put in, but you'll need @GRN@EXP@END@ for everything you do in the anvil. Or you can take another of that item and put it in as replacement for the materials. This can fix up your tools as well as being able to combine two armor's enchantments together. By that, I mean that if Tool A had one enchantment, and Tool B had another, you could put them into an anvil to combine them. If you're adding enchantments, you can use the @BLU@Enchanted Books@END@ with enchants on them to put the enchant onto your tools. Lastly, see that little text bar on top of the anvil screen with your tool name? You can change it however you want and at the cost of very little EXP, you can name @UND@ANY@END@ block/item in the game. Neat! Be sure to note however, every time you use an anvil, you will lower its durability until eventually after enough usages, it will break. There is no way around this. One last thing you can use anvils for is dropping them on things! Yes, anvils actually obey the laws of gravity in this game! Dropping anvils on mobs hurts, a lot. But it also damages the anvil too depending on whatever heigh you drop it from so be careful!

guide.vanilla.entry.everythingWood=@BLU@Wood@END@ as stated previously, has many uses. There are 6 different types of wood in Minecraft including: @BLU@Oak, Spruce, Birch, Jungle, Acacia, @RST@and @BLU@Dark Oak@END@. You can find them in different @GRN@Biomes@END@ across the Minecraft world. They can each be made into @BLU@Planks@RST@, Stairs@RST@, Slabs@END@, and other wooden blocks including @BLU@Saplings@END@ and their respective @BLU@Leaves@END@. Shown on the next page is a list of he 6 different types of woods and their respective products.
guide.vanilla.entry.everythingWood2=There are many more blocks that can be made with wood such as @BLU@Fences, Trapdoors, Fence Gates, Doors, Buttons, Ladders@END@, and @BLU@Signs@END@. Most will be mentioned in the Redstone Logic chapters except the sign, once placed it will allow the user to type a certain amount of text within 4 lines on the sign. It is important to note that everything wooden is susceptible to being burned up by fire/catch on fire if nearby fire or lava blocks are present.
guide.vanilla.entry.naturalGrowth=There are many plants found scattered all over the @AQA@Overworld@END@ including all 6 different types of trees, @BLU@Tallgrass, Ferns, Flowers, Pumpkins, Vines, Sugarcane, Cactus, @RST@and @BLU@Mushrooms@END@. There are also @BLU@Lilypads@END@ that spawn in Swamp biomes across the Overworld. These lilypads cannot in any way, spread/grow. They do however, act as a platform that you can stand on, but @BLU@Boats@END@ beware! It's a solid block! Apart from the Overworld, the only plant that grows in the @DRED@Nether@END@ is the @BLU@Nether Wart@END@ which only grows in @DRED@Nether Fortresses@END@. Refer to the @GRN@Biomes@END@ entry in The World Around You for more information on where to find the various plants. Some plants require @BLU@Shears@END@ to harvest such as tallgrass, vines, and ferns. Also, one elusive type of plant that only grows in @GRN@Jungle@END@ biomes are the @BLU@Cocoa Beans@END@! These bean pods hang to the sides of jungle trees. Once fully mature, they break open with much more @BLU@Cocoa Seeds@END@ allowing them to be replanted again. @BLU@Melons@END@ may also sometimes grow in the jungle in small patches similar to pumpkins.
guide.vanilla.entry.growingPlants=Farming is a necessity for anyone looking for a stable, self-contained food supply. As complex as it may seem to effectively gather food from such methods, it actually isn't. First, you have to understand the basics of farming. @BLU@Tilled Soil@END@ comes from right-clicking a @BLU@Hoe@END@ on a @BLU@Grass@RST@/@BLU@Dirt@END@ block. However, if it isn't near @BLU@Water@END@, it will quickly revert back to dirt. Water must be on the same Y-Level as the soil is, and the water must also be within 4 blocks.
guide.vanilla.entry.growingPlants2=As you can see, the radius of a water block is pretty large. Anywhere on this tilled farmland, you can plant crops. It should be noted that farmland will disappear if: the water is taken away, or if an @GLD@Entity@END@ jumps on it/falls on it.
guide.vanilla.entry.crops=Crops are plants that grow on @BLU@Farmland@END@ and produce something usually food. Crops include: @BLU@Wheat, Carrots, Potatoes, Melons, @RST@and @BLU@Pumpkins@END@. Wheat grows from @BLU@Seeds@END@ which can be found by breaking @BLU@Tallgrass@END@ in the @AQA@Overworld@END@. Carrots and potatoes are harder to obtain; they can be found on @GRY@Villages@END@ or rarely from killing @RED@Zombies@END@. Crops must be fully mature until they can be harvested. Melons are found only in @GRY@Dungeons@END@ but pumpkins can be found in the wild growing in clusters. Melons and pumpkins have a distinct growing style where they come from seeds (place a @BLU@Watermelon Slice@END@ or pumpkin in a @BLU@Crafting Table@END@) and sprout a stem. The stem once mature, will grow a melon/pumpkin block on its four adjacent sides provided that the sides are clear from obstructions and the block underneath is dirt/grass/farmland. Hint: Pumpkins can be turned into @BLU@Jack o'Lanterns@END@ or worn on the head. Anything that is a crop, sapling, or mushroom can be grown more quickly by applying @BLU@Bone Meal@END@ to it.
guide.vanilla.entry.otherFlora=Now, apart from all the crops that you can grow, there are some other unusual types of flora that you can grow as well such as @BLU@Sugarcane@END@. Sugarcane needs to be planted on @BLU@Grass, Dirt, @END@or @BLU@Sand@END@ which also have to be next to a @BLU@Water@END@ source block. They require light like other plants and can grow to a maximum height of 3. @BLU@Cacti@END@ is a desert-dwelling plant that can only be grown on sand. Cactus must also not have any adjacent blocks next to it otherwise it will break. Like sugarcane, it grows to a maximum height of 3 as well. Vines are easy plants to grow, just place them on a solid surface and as long as there is nothing underneath, it will gradually grow down until it hits a surface. @BLU@Nether Wart@END@ is interesting in that it only grows on @BLU@Soul Sand@END@ and requires little light. @BLU@Tallgrass@END@ and @BLU@Flowers@END@ cannot be grown; instead they come from applying @BLU@Bone Meal@END@ to a patch of @BLU@Dirt@END@/@BLU@Grass@END@.
guide.vanilla.entry.treeFarm=Tree farms are nifty and convenient since you don't have to go around deforesting entire areas to obtain @BLU@Wood@END@. To make one, you simply need @BLU@Saplings@END@ which are obtainable from decaying @BLU@Leaves@END@ from previous trees. Just plant the sapling on @BLU@Dirt@END@/@BLU@Grass@END@, give it enough time and sunlight, and eventually it will sprout into a tree as long as there is enough space. The amount of space that trees require depends on the type, for instance, @BLU@Oak@END@ and @BLU@Birch@END@ require little space compared to the @BLU@Jungle@END@ trees, which require a large amount of space to grow. @BLU@Bone Meal@END@ can aid with the process of growing as well. The leaves of trees can be collected by using @BLU@Shears@END@ and used later on for decoration or other purposes.
guide.vanilla.entry.mushrooms="It is the year 2552, @BLU@Mushrooms@END@ dominate every part of life; you are controlled by a giant mushroom with it's @GRN@Mooshroom@END@ servants providing everyone with mushroom supplies." Sounds pretty cool right? Mushrooms are an interesting type of plant, or more correctly, a fungi. There are two types of mushrooms, the brown mushroom and the red mushroom. Both are extremely similar. Mushrooms can only thrive in areas with little to no light (i.e. @GRN@Swamps@END@, Caves, and even the @DRED@Nether@END@) If they are in contact with large amounts of light, they will disappear. You can grow these little fellas in two ways: The first is placing it down in a dark area with room to spread and eventually, it will spread. The second is by applying @BLU@Bone Meal@END@ to it in a dark area with plenty of space (vertically) for it to grow. You can cut these tall mushroom "trees" down yielding more mushrooms. However, there is a material that can drastically reduce the amount of time needed for both of these processes. It is called @BLU@Mycelium@END@ and is only found on the elusive @GRN@Biome@END@, the @GRN@Mushroom Islands@END@ biome. Mushrooms growing on mycelium can withstand light, grow to full trees naturally, and spread much quicker.
guide.vanilla.entry.wildFood=Food may seem sparse in this world of Minecraft at first, but if you know where to look, then you'll be set. One of the most basic foods that you can find is the @BLU@Apple@END@ that comes from @BLU@Oak Leaves@END@ when they decay or you break them. Though not extremely nutritious, apples can sustain you for a short while as you search for more food. If you have a @BLU@Fishing Rod@END@, you can fish for some @BLU@Raw Fish@END@END@ and cook it up in a @BLU@Furnace@END@. See any @GRN@Cows, Pigs@END@, or @GRN@Chickens@END@ nearby? If you need food desperately, you can kill them for their meat and cook it in a furnace as well. If you cross any villages, you can harvest the mature crops such as @BLU@Wheat, Carrots@END@, and @BLU@Potatoes@END@. Carrots can be eaten raw (and so can potatoes but you should cook them) while wheat can be turned into @BLU@Bread@END@, which is a decent food source. If you have the two types of @BLU@Mushrooms@END@, you can combine them with a @BLU@Bowl@END@ and get @BLU@Mushroom Stew@END@ which is quite nutritious and will fill you up.
guide.vanilla.entry.cookingSteve=No! Not cooking you! Cooking food! Minecraft has a pretty extensive food network where you can make and bake plenty of different kinds of food. Take for instance, the @BLU@Cake@END@! (Tis not a lie). You can make cake with a few ingredients and then place it down on a surface to enjoy! Right-click it to eat! Some other treats include @BLU@Cookies@END@ and @BLU@Pumpkin Pie@END@. The pie especially, will you fill you up completely! @BLU@Melon Slices@END@ are also a nice treat and a simple food source to have that are plentiful when you harvest @BLU@Melons@END@. Finally, some top Notch foods that you might want to take a look at is the @BLU@Golden Apple@END@. These apples of supremacy have two variants: the normal ones, and the enchanted ones (sometimes referred to as "Notch" apples). The normal ones when eaten, will give you @LPRP@Abosorption@END@ for 2 minutes and @LPRP@Regeneration@END@ (LVL 2) for 5 seconds. The enchanted ones however, will grant @LPRP@Absorption@END@ for 2 minutes, and @LPRP@Regeneration@END@ (LVL 5) for 30 seconds, @LPRP@Fire Resistance@END@ for 5 minutes, and @LPRP@Resistance@END@ for 5 minutes. Extremely powerful. Another item (that isn't food, but worth checking out) is the @BLU@Milk Bucket@END@. The milk bucket is obtained from milking cows. Drinking the milk will rid of all potion effects currently active (good and bad).

guide.vanilla.entry.redstone=@BLU@Redstone@END@ is the embodiment of creativity and logic working together to create things that are, simply put, extraordinary. Even if you're not a complete math wizard, you can still easily use redstone to make your playing experience much richer, and complex. To begin with, redstone is a type of dust found from mining @BLU@Redstone Ore@END@ (near @BLU@Diamonds@END@). This dust can be placed within the world leaving a red trail wherever it is. By itself, it's completely static, and does nothing. (Mathematical terms ahead) Redstone is a binary system much like electricity is. It's either on, or off. Most redstone activated blocks need to have a redstone signal being applied to them meaning that there needs to be redstone somewhere that is on. Types of redstone blocks can be classified into three categories: toggles, conductors, and recipients. Toggles are blocks that can both output/not output a redstone signal. Toggles include: @BLU@Levers, Buttons, Pressure Plates, Redstone Torches@END@, and @BLU@Daylight Sensors@END@ (@BLU@Redstone Blocks@END@ are a special case). Conductors are blocks that can carry a redstone signal over a distance. Conductors include: @BLU@Redstone, Redstone Repeaters@END@, and @BLU@Redstone Comparators@END@. Solid blocks can be turned into "conductors" as you will learn later on. Finally, recipients are blocks that can receive a redstone signal thereby activating/deactivating something. Some examples of recipients include: @BLU@Pistons, Hoppers, Doors@END@, and @BLU@Fence Gates@END@ just to name a few.
guide.vanilla.entry.deeperRedstone=You might have thought that last entry was a lot to take in, but you've only scratched the surface of @BLU@Redstone@END@! In this entry, we will delve a bit deeper into the mechanics of redstone, namely the "dust" form (as you'll hear it referred to as). Just a sidenote, all redstone blocks (toggles/conductors) can only be placed on solid, opaque objects which don't include @BLU@Glass@END@ and other non "full" solid blocks. Redstone dust can carry a redstone signal for up to 15 blocks. This means, that a trail of redstone dust from a source onwards, will only carry the "on" or redstone signal for 15 blocks. After 15 blocks, the signal is too weak to be carried. But that's not it! Redstone signals can be differentiated into 2 types: direct redstone signals, and indirect redstone signals (can be referred to as strong/weak). A direct redstone signal (can only be accomplished through a @BLU@Redstone Repeater@END@ means that a redstone signal is being directed towards a block as opposed to the indirect redstone signal, in which case the redstone signal is not directed at the block. What's the difference? Well, a direct signal can activate redstone recipients, but it can also "force" the block that is is being directed into, to become a conductor. Indirect signals can also activate redstone recipients, but they cannot "force" a redstone signal through a block. Redstone dust exerts a weak redstone signal upon the block that it is on. One more thing about redstone dust, as it trails further away from a toggle, its strength weakens. This can be differentiated into 15 different levels of strengths (15 blocks equals 1 different level of strength per block each one declining as it gets farther and farther away from the source). Images are shown to clear up any confusion.
guide.vanilla.entry.toggles=Toggles as mentioned before are blocks that can both output and not output a redstone signal. Most toggles emit a strong redstone signal (directed towards the block that they are on) @BLU@Levers@END@ are your most basic toggle that when right click it, turns it on and it will sustain a redstone signal as long as it is on; it emits a strong redstone signal to the block that is on, and a weak signal to all other blocks. Useful for things that require a sustained redstone signal. @BLU@Buttons@END@ (vary in wooden and stone (wooden ones can be activated by shooting it with an arrow)) are your second most basic type of toggle. Like a lever, when pushed, it will emit a strong redstone signal to the block that it is on, and a weak one to all other sides. However, a few moments after it is pushed, it will spring back, cutting the redstone signal. Useful for things that require a pulse of redstone. @BLU@Redstone Torches@END@ are torches that emit a redstone signal on all sides EXCEPT the block that it's on. These torches are special since if a weak redstone signal is applied to the block it is on, it will turn off the redstone torch.
guide.vanilla.entry.toggles2=Some other toggles include the @BLU@Daylight Sensor@END@ which outputs a redstone signal; the strength of th signal corresponds to the amount of sunlight that there is (midday would have the strongest output while nighttime would have no output). It outputs a weak signal. @BLU@Pressure Plates@END@ are blocks that when an entity is on top of, will output a strong redstone signal to the block that is on, and a weak signal to all other directions. It is differentiated between wooden, stone, iron, and gold (last two are referred to as Weighted). Wooden and stone pressure plates activate when an entity steps on it, but the wooden one triggers for an Item Entity while the stone one does not. Weighted pressure plates on the other hand, output a redstone signal with strength correspondent to the number of entities that are on it (light = 1:1 ratio while heavy = 1:10 ratio (strength:entities)). The last toggle, a special case, is the @BLU@Redstone Block@END@. It outputs a weak redstone signal in every direction. Unlike other toggles however, it will always output a signal and cannot turn "off".
guide.vanilla.entry.conductors=Conductors are blocks that can carry a redstone signal. This means that if a redstone signal is passed through them, it will continue it through itself. Think of wires that conduct electricity if you're having trouble understanding. Conductors include: @BLU@Redstone, Redstone Repeaters@END@, and @BLU@Redstone Comparators@END@. You should probably be familiar with redstone, or redstone dust; it can sustain a redstone signal for up to 15 blocks, can only go on the UP face of a block, and can only go on solid blocks. Redstone repeaters however, are a one-way signal director in that, it takes an input from one end, and outputs it on the opposite end. The point of repeaters is that it 'repeats' the signal as if it were a source block emitting on a single side. You can also toggle a delay on a repeater by right-clicking it which means that the higher the delay, the longer it takes for the input to be 'repeated' to the output. (Only goes up to 4 ticks) This function is useful for timed contraptions. Images shown for clarity.
guide.vanilla.entry.conductors2=The last conductor is the Redstone Comparator. As its name implies, it compares signals to one another. There are two modes (toggle by right-clicking it) and has 4 different functions. The first most basic is the Maintain function which takes the input strength and outputs it at the same strength unlike a repeater. This is useful as a work around along possible connections that you don't want happening. The second function is the Comparison function, for this, the comparator needs to be in Comparison mode (front torch down and unpowered). In this mode, it will compare it's input (rear) signal with its side signals. If either of the two sides are greater in strength than the rear signal, then the comparator's output turns off. If they are both the same as the rear input, then the comparator will use the Maintain function instead. The third function is the Subtract Signal function, for this, the comparator must be in Subtraction mode (front torch up and powered). In this mode, it will subtract the signal strength of the highest of the two sides from the rear input and output the result. This may seem confusing, but the images will clear it up. The last function is the Measure Block State function. When put (with the input facing the block) against a block that can be measured, it will output a signal strength that is proportional to whatever the block is measuring (i.e. @BLU@Chests@END@ will output a higher strength as they fill up with items) Images shown for clarity.
guide.vanilla.entry.recipients=Recipients are a large group; anything that accepts a redstone signal which in turns activates/deactivates something is considered a recipient. For now, we'll just take a look at a few of these such as @BLU@Hoppers, Pistons, Doors/Trapdoors/Fence Gates@END@, and @BLU@Redstone Lamps@END@. Hoppers are blocks that can suction items from an inventory above and output it to wherever the output funnel is facing. For instance, if there was a @BLU@Chest@END@ on top of a hopper with items inside, the hopper would suck out the items into its own inventory and output it either to the sides or to the bottom. Hoppers also suck any item entities floating above it as well. If a redstone signal is applied, then it will stop sucking in items and outputting them from its inventory. There is a @BLU@Minecart@END@ variant of this with the exact same properties as the block one. Pistons are blocks that once a redstone signal is applied to them, will push whatever block/entity is in front of it when it extends. The piston can only push certain blocks such as non tile-entities, and other "simple" blocks. It has a @BLU@Sticky@END@ variant which makes the block that it is connected to stick to the piston. Pistons are found within almost every single redstone contraption as their uses range far and wide from making secret doors, to block update triggers. Doors, trapdoors, and fences are simple: when a redstone signal is applied to them, they open up, by default, they are closed. Finally, redstone lamps are blocks that once a redstone signal is applied, will light up like a torch. Useful for controlling things like interior lights, or mob farms.
guide.vanilla.entry.sneaky=So...interested in traps are you? Come take a look, we have things that might interest you! First, there's the @BLU@Tripwire Hook@END@. When connected to a block and an opposing tripwire hook via @BLU@String@END@, it will emit a strong redstone signal to the block that it is on when an entity steps onto the tripwire. @BLU@Dispensers@END@ with @BLU@Arrows@END@? Sounds like a wonderful trap to me! Another useful trick is the @BLU@Trapped Chest@END@. It looks so similar to an ordinary @BLU@Chest@END@ yet with one thing extra: Any time it is opened, it will emit a redstone signal on all sides of it. Goes with the name doesn't it?
guide.vanilla.entry.circuitsInverts=Now let's get on to the complex things shall we? If you're still a beginner to redstone, this might/might not be a good place for you to start. It's going to get a bit mathy in here! Let's start off with circuits. Circuits is a broad term used to describe any @BLU@Redstone@END@ "gate" that has an input/output, and does something that modifies the output in a specific way. Confusing? If you know logic gates (electricity), then you'll be set. Circuits are basically that, logic gates, just with redstone instead of electricity. One of the most basic circuit is the Invert. The Invert basically takes in a signal on/off, and outputs the reverse. Multiple ways shown in these images:
guide.vanilla.entry.circuitsInverts2=Getting the hang of it? Good. You'll need a certain degree of logic to understand these circuits better and in time, use them for your own creations! The following entries are different types of circuits and show how they work. To be clear, circuits/gates are defined by simply what they do; anything that does the same thing as another gate IS essentially that gate just made in a different manner. These following diagrams only show you ONE way to make these gates; you can make your own! Remember, this is Minecraft! These aren't the only things you're limited to! Feel free to create your own different kinds of circuits to suit your own person needs!
guide.vanilla.entry.clocks=Well, this isn't exactly a circuit, but more of a useful contraption. A Clock is basically a closed-circuit system where a signal is constantly/repeatedly outputted (think of a clock repeatedly looping). On the following images are different types of Clocks.
guide.vanilla.entry.and=AND circuits are basically circuits that require input 1 AND input 2 to be on in order for it to output. Notice the word similarity. What you'll see is the consistent use of Inverts throughout many gates. Simply taking them out or adding them in will invert the signal; tinker around with it and see how you like it!
guide.vanilla.entry.and2=In any case, any AND circuit must have all inputs ON/OFF in order for it to output. That said, you can easily have more than 2 inputs (or 1) to suit your individual needs. A NAND circuit is basically the invert of the AND gate (output is default ON) as shown here:
guide.vanilla.entry.and3=The NOT circuit is a circuit where when any input is ON, the output turns OFF. Image:
guide.vanilla.entry.or=The OR gate is a simple gate in the fact that if any inputs are ON, the output turns ON as well. Likewise, the NOR is simply an inverted version. If any input is ON, then the output turns OFF (ON default).
guide.vanilla.entry.xor=The XOR gate is similar to the OR gate but different by a tiny bit. If one input is ON, then the output is ON; however, if both inputs are ON, then the output is OFF (default OFF). Useful for things such as lighting in a room or door systems.
guide.vanilla.entry.flipFlops=In Minecraft, we can flip-flop the flip table in memory so that it flops straight into the end credits for an instant speedrun. (Anyone get the reference?) Anyways....flip-flops are basically complex circuits that do something different if certain conditions are met. First, we're going to introduce you to the T-Flip Flop. This is most commonly used to "turn a button into a lever". When the @BLU@Button@END@ is pressed once, the flip flop changes its mode; when pressed again, it changes again.
guide.vanilla.entry.flipFlops2=The other flip-flop that we'll see is the D-Flip Flop. This flip-flop has 2 inputs. One is a @BLU@Lever@END@ or anything that sustains and the other is a @BLU@Button@END@ or anything that pulses. When the lever is down, the output will stay on no matter the input from the button. If the lever is off, and the button is pressed, the output will pulse however preventing the lever from "locking" it. To lock, the lever must be toggled ON and the button must be pressed. If all that was confusing, just think of the D-Flip Flop as both a button with a lock. Turning the lever on locks it ON, otherwise it will function like a button.
guide.vanilla.entry.latches=Latches are memory gates that function differently each time that they are activated. The first latch that we are introducing is the RS (NOR) Latch. The RS NOR Lath is extremely basic in that, it can receive 2 inputs; when 1 specific input is pressed, it changes 'mode'. To change it back, the other input must be pressed, otherwise it will stay as it is.
guide.vanilla.entry.latches2=Some other latches include the RS Latch which is a bit more complex and the Transparent Latch. These function similar to other latches in that they must be toggled in 2 different places to change their states. (No pictures shown)
guide.vanilla.entry.usefulContraptions=This book could go on, and on about different sorts of gates and latches and what not. But the intro unfortunately has to end. But before it does, we still have a few useful contraptions that you could definitely use! First, it's the Randomizer, as its name suggests, it will output a random redstone signal at random moments. Randomizers come in all shapes and sizes including this not-so-practical one that we're about to show you. As long as it's random, it's a Randomizer!
guide.vanilla.entry.usefulContraptions=Pretty crazy right> Well, that contraption makes good use of another contraption that we'll show you later called the BUD (Block Update Detector). Basically, whenever a block 'updates' or changes, it will fire and emit a redstone pulse. Since @GRN@Sheep@END@ eat @BLU@Grass@END@ at random times, that is a random event. A grass block is placed next to a BUD so whenever it changes to @BLU@Dirt@END@, it will fire a redstone pulse. This is random since the sheep eating the grass occurs at random intervals! Be creative in your contraptions!

guide.vanilla.entry.differentTypesMobs=You may have noticed that you're not the only thing walking around in this world of Minecraft. Oh no, there are plenty of other living creatures inhabiting the world alongside you. Let's begin declassifying them shall we? First, if you're playing in @GLD@Peaceful Mode@END@, you won't see a portion of the listed mobs. Switch your mode to change that. The first type of mobs are the @GRN@Peaceful@END@ ones. These mobs will under no circumstances attack you, even if you attack them. When attacked, they will run try to run away from their attacker. Peaceful mobs include: @GRN@Cows, Pigs, Sheep, Chicken, Horses, Donkeys, Mules, Squids, Ocelots, Mooshrooms, Villagers@END@, and @GRN@Bats@END@. Often these mobs will have more to gain by breeding them or trading with them than just killing them. The second type of mobs is @GLD@Neutral@END@. These mobs will not instinctively attack you UNLESS you have done something to provoke them (usually). Then...it's up to you to survive their attack. Neutral mobs include: @GLD@Cave Spiders (special case), Spiders (special case), Endermen, Zombie Pigmen@END@, and @GLD@Wolves@END@. The third type of mobs is @RED@Hostile@END@. These mobs will attack on sight and will follow you until you are dead. Be careful when dealing with these types of mobs, especially in large numbers. Hostile mobs include: @RED@Blazes, Creepers, Ghasts, Magma Cubes, Silverfish, Skeletons, Slimes, Spider Jockeys, Witches, Wither Skeletons, Zombies@END@, and @RED@Zombie Villagers@END@. A subset of mobs are the @BLU@Tameable@END@ mobs. These mobs as their name suggests, can be tamed by the player. These mobs include: @BLU@Horses, Mules, Donkeys, Ocelots@END@, and @BLU@Wolves@END@. Another subset are the 2 @DBLU@Utility@END@ mobs. They are the @DBLU@Iron Golems@END@, and @DBLU@Snow Golems@END@. Utility mobs (usually) serve a good purpose to the player although not being affiliated with the player like tameable ones are. The last type of mobs, are the @DRED@@BLD@Bosses@END@. Bosses are nasty mobs that give a tough fight usually rewarding a rare goodie at the end. Bosses include: @DGRY@The Wither@END@, and the @PRP@@BLD@@UND@Ender Dragon@END@. Be extremely careful and cautious when dealing with bosses as they are quite dangerous.
guide.vanilla.entry.farmAnimals=Farm animals are the following @GRN@Peaceful@END@ mobs: @GRN@Cows (+ Mooshrooms), Pigs, Sheep@END@, and @GRN@Chickens@END@. Characteristics that make these farm animals unique include: Being able to breed, and having a unique item that comes from it. Breeding occurs when two of the same animal species are given a specific item. These items are called "breeding items". If you hold this breeding item in your hand, the certain animals that breed with it will follow you around for a short time period. Once two animals breed, an offspring pops out (aka a cute baby!) which will eventually grow up to become an adult. Once an animal has bred, it has a certain cool-down period before it can breed again. Breeding also does not occur naturally, you must do it. Note: Killing baby animals will not yield anything so don't do it. Another Note: If an animal is on fire and it dies, (in lava or on fire), and if it drops meat, the meat will be cooked instead of raw. A useful item to keep farm animals in place is the @BLU@Lead@END@. The lead allows the user to tie onto an animal. If the player moves, the animal will be pulled along with the player. If the animal cannot move yet the player keeps on moving, the lead will break. You can also tie animals to fences by right-clicking them with a lead and then right clicking the lead to a fence. Another useful item (can be applied to any type of mob) is the @BLU@Name Tag@END@ You can use these to name a mob whatever you want. Simply place the name tag inside an @BLU@Anvil@END@ and name it whatever you want the mob name to be. Then right-click the name tag onto the mob that you want to name. Named mobs will not despawn.
guide.vanilla.entry.cows=Moooooooo! @GRN@Cows@END@ spawn in the @AQA@Overworld@END@ in herds of 4 with a light level of 9 or higher. They can be bred together with @BLU@Wheat@END@ and have a cool-down time of 5 minutes. Cows drop @BLU@Leather@END@ and @BLU@Raw Beef@END@ when killed. Cows can be milked by right-clicking them with a @BLU@Bucket@END@. A "variant" of cows is the @BLU@Mooshroom@END@; quite rare considering that they only spawn in the @GRN@Mushroom Islands@END@ biomes. These white-red animals however, have much more use than just being adorable. They can be "milked" with a @BLU@Bowl@END@ to get @BLU@Mushroom Soup@END@ or  milk them with a bucket to get milk if you really wanted to. You can shear them to get lots of @BLU@Red Mushrooms@END@. Shearing them however, turns them into ordinary cows. ;(
guide.vanilla.entry.pigs=Oink! @GRN@Pigs@END@ everywhere! Pigs spawn in the @AQA@Overworld@END@ on @BLU@Grass@END@ blocks with a light level of 9 or higher. They can be bred together with @BLU@Carrots@END@ and have a cool-down of 5 minutes. Pigs drop @BLU@Raw Porkchops@END@ when killed. But besides that, pigs can be saddled up with a @BLU@Saddle@END@ and be ridden around with a @BLU@Carrot On A Stick@END@ as means of transportation. Cute but not too efficient. Note: If a pig is struck by lightning, it will transform into a @RED@Zombie Pigmen@END@.
guide.vanilla.entry.sheep=Baaaa! @GRN@Sheep@END@ spawn in the @AQA@Overworld@END@ on @BLU@Grass@END@ blocks with a light level of 9 or higher. They have a small percent chance of being spawned with a wool color other than white (can either be light gray, dark gray, black, brown, or pink). Sheep drop 1 @BLU@Wool@END@ when killed, but drop multiple wool when sheared instead (so don't kill them!) as long as they have a coat of wool. Sheep can be dyed with any color dye that you have with the resulting wool color staying that dye color. They can be bred with @BLU@Wheat@END@ with a cool-down of 5 minutes. They will randomly eat nearby grass blocks turning them into @BLU@Dirt@END@. When bred, the resulting baby sheep's wool color will be a mixture of the two parents (for example, if a red sheep and a yellow sheep bred, the resulting sheep would have a wool color of orange). Sheep will regenerate their wool coats after eating grass. P.S. If a sheep is named _jeb, then its wool will become multicolored, but still retain the same dye as it had originally (this is only a visual effect).
guide.vanilla.entry.chickens=Peck peck! @GRN@Chickens@END@ can be found in the @AQA@Overworld@END@ on @BLU@Grass@END@ blocks with a light level of 9 or higher. They can be bred with @BLU@Seeds@END@ OR you can also collect @BLU@Eggs@END@ that they tend to drop wherever they go and throw them. These eggs have a 1/8 chance of spawning a baby chicken. Chickens drop @BLU@Feathers@END@ and @BLU@Raw Chicken@END@. Chickens are immune to fall damage since they flap their wings around slowing their descent. However, one variant of the chicken that you should be careful of is the @RED@Chicken Jockey@END@. Similar to the @RED@Spider Jockey@END@, a chicken jockey is a baby @RED@Zombie@END@ riding a chicken resulting in a comical yet painful enemy. Chickens that are/were chicken jockeys do not spawn eggs.
guide.vanilla.entry.ocelots=Meeeooww! @GRN@Ocelots@END@ are shy creatures that spawn on @BLU@Grass@END@ or @BLU@Leaves@END@ in @GRN@Jungle Biomes@END@. They will naturally hunt @GRN@Chickens@END@ so keep them away from your farms! Killing them however, gives you nothing, so don't do it!. Ocelots also happen to be immune to fall damage (HIGH-RISE SYNDROME!). These shy creatures are easily scared by sudden movements like you; in order to tame them, you must be extremely slow and precarious. Holding @BLU@Raw Fish@END@ and sneaking near an ocelot will cause it to gradually come towards you. No sudden movements! You can then feed it the fish to tame it into a @GRN@Cat@END@! There's a chance that it might take a fish and not be tamed however, then you must repeat the process. Once tamed, the new cat will have either a tabby, tuxedo, or Siamese coat. Cats will follow the player around and no longer attack chickens. You can make them sit by right-clicking them and they will stay sitting. If a player moves far away from the cat (and it is not sitting), it will teleport to the player. Cats that are not sitting have a habit of sitting on blocks such as @BLU@Chests, Furnaces@END@, and @BLU@Beds@END@. If a cat is sitting on a block, it becomes unusable for as long the cat is on it. One thing to note is that @RED@Creepers@END@ will actively avoid ocelots and cats, so it might not be a bad idea to keep some in your base.
guide.vanilla.entry.horses=@GRN@Horses@END@ are large animals that spawn in the @AQA@Overworld@END@ in @GRN@Plains@END@ and @GRN@Savanna@END@ biomes. They have multiple variations in skin colors with 2 other sub-species: the @GRN@Donkey@END@ and the @GRN@Mule@END@. Donkeys spawn naturally (although more rarely) with horses in the wild. Mules however, do not spawn naturally (more on that later). When killed, horses drop @BLU@Leather@END@. Now, if you try and saddle on one in the wild right away, it'll kick you off. You have to tame it first! You can tame it by either repeatedly riding it, or you can feed the horse/donkey/mule with these items: @BLU@Sugar, Wheat, Apples, Golden Carrots@END@, and @BLU@Golden Apples@END@. They will shoot out hearts when tamed. Feeding tamed horses/donkeys (mules can't breed) golden carrots/golden apples will cause them to try and breed with others that have been fed as well. Baby horses/donkeys/mules are born untamed. You'll have to tame them yourself. Taming them allows you to put a @BLU@Saddle@END@ on them and ride them around. You can also (if they're horses) put @BLU@Horse Armor@END@ on them to protect the horse when it is attacked. You can attack while you are on these animals. Feeding them one of the breeding items increases their growth rate. Babies usually inherit one of their parent's color and also have a chance at having a higher speed/health/jump height than their parents (selective breeding). Breeding a horse and a donkey together will result in a mule. Mules are slower than donkeys but have are pretty useful. Once tamed, you can shift-right-click with a @BLU@Chest@END@ in your hand to add side inventories to it. This makes it so that the mule can carry item/blocks wherever it goes. You can heal horses/donkeys/mules that are hurt with any of the breeding items or a @BLU@Hay Bale@END@ which heals the most.
guide.vanilla.entry.selectiveBreeding=ONLY APPLIES TO HORSES/DONKEYS/MULES Selective breeding is a long process that's goals are to make a significantly higher stat @GRN@Horse/Donkey/Mule@END@ than those found elsewhere. The first steps of selective breeding is to find out what stats, or stats that you're planning on increasing. Here are the possible stats: Health, which has a possible range of 15-30, and usually an average of 22.5 in the wild; Jump Height, which has a possible range of 1.5-5.5 blocks and an average of 3.5 in the wild; Speed, which has a range of 0.1125-0.3375 internal units with an average of 0.225. When breeding, the resulting foal's stats are determined by averaging the two parent's stats with a third randomly determined set. Due to this randomness, selective breeding can take quite awhile. Also, it should be noted that you cannot measure stats from a baby, you must grow it up and tame it to test its stats out. I'd recommend making separate pens for different stats of animals and put the improved ones in a different one breeding them together to get better and better stats.
guide.vanilla.entry.batSquids=@GRN@Bats@END@!! These tiny little flying creatures don't actually do much. They don't drop anything, and in general, are a nuisance at their best. Bats spawn in the @AQA@Overworld@END@ at light levels of 4 or less on opaque blocks below sea level. Bats "sleep" during the day and fly around at night and hang upside down on blocks when they're idle. Other than that, there's not much to talk about. They can't breed or even be attached to a @BLU@Lead@END@. Moving onto @GRN@Squids@END@, they spawn in @BLU@Water@END@ in any biome between Y-levels of 46 and sea level. When killed, they will drop @BLU@Ink Sacs@END@. They're pretty derpy looking and will eventually suffocate if it's on land for two long. While on land, it cannot move. They can however, swim against currents unlike any other mob. Too bad they can't be dyed...
guide.vanilla.entry.villagers=@GRN@Villager@END@ are probably the most intelligent and complex mob in the game. They spawn in Villages, sometimes with @DBLU@Iron Golems@END@ that will protect them from any harm. You can trade with villagers exchanging a variety of different items such as @BLU@Gold, Iron, Wheat@END@, and @BLU@Wool@END@ to name a few. Their main currency is made up of @BLU@Emeralds@END@ so it's a good idea to invest in some. Villagers have a complex system of breeding depending on nearby @BLU@Doors@END@ and the specific setup of such doors. If you're interested in breeding villagers, I advise you to go look up a tutorial on how to since it is quite complex. @RED@Zombies@END@ on the other hand, are their worst nightmare. Villagers are completely defenseless and zombies will track them down from lengths of up to 42 blocks. On @GLD@Hard@END@ mode, they can even break down doors to get to villagers (same for @RED@Zombie Pigmen@END@). Zombies will kill villagers, or turn them into @RED@Zombie Villager@END@ (chance depending on the difficulty of the game). Iron Golems are effectively their only form of defense. Notably, if lightning strikes within the vicinity of a villager, it will turn the villager into a @RED@Witch@END@.
guide.vanilla.entry.wolves=@GLD@Wolves@END@ are pack hunters that spawn in the @AQA@Overworld@END@ in @GRN@Forest@END@, and @GRN@Taiga@END@ biomes. They spawn untamed, and if attacked by the player, will retaliate. They do not drop anything when killed. In the wild, they will naturally hunt @RED@Skeletons@END@, and @GRN@Sheep@END@. To tame wolves, you can feed them @BLU@Bones@END@. Once tamed, they will turn into @GRN@Dogs@END@ that have a collar. Tamed wolves will still attack skeletons on sight, but will not attack sheep. Tamed wolves will also (if their master is nearby) attack any hostile mobs/players that harm their master. They won't however, attack @RED@Creepers@END@, @RED@Ghasts@END@ or @GRN@Tamed Horses@END@. Like @GRN@Cats@END@, they will sit when your right-click them, and teleport if you're far away (and they're not sitting). They won't sit on @BLU@Chests, Furnaces@END@, and @BLU@Beds@END@. Dogs can be bred and healed with any sort of @BLU@Raw Meat@END@ (excluding @BLU@Fish@END@). Their collars can also be dyed with different colors by using @BLU@Dye@END@ (right-click them with the dye).
guide.vanilla.entry.spiders=@GLD@Spiders@END@ are 8-legged arthropods that roam the @AQA@Overworld@END@ and spawn at a ligt level of 7 or less. They have the unique ability to climb walls. One special case about spiders is that they are hostile at night, and only neutral while the light level is 9 or higher. Spiders drop @BLU@String@END@ and @BLU@Spider Eyes@END@ when killed. However, if provoked, they will continue to chase players even into well lit locations until they have been damaged by a source other than the player. Spiders are also immune to the @PRP@Poison@END@ effect. When they attack, they will leap up knocking it's enemy back. There are 2 variants of the spider, one called the @RED@Spider Jockey@END@. The spider jockey isn't actually a mob, but a combination of 2. It spawns at a 1% chance when a skeleton is spawned riding atop the spider. The other variant is the @GLD@Cave Spider@END@; a bluish hued, smaller spider that spawns from @BLU@Monster Spawners@END@ or from Mineshafts. If you're playing on a difficulty that is higher than @GLD@Easy@END@, then its attack will give you @LPRP@Poison@END@. Spiders are also not affected by @BLU@Cobwebs@END@.
guide.vanilla.entry.endermen=The tall, slender, and elusive @GLD@Endermen@END@ roam the @PRP@End@END@ and spawn in the @AQA@Overworld@END@ on solid blocks with a light level of 7 or less. While they are considered neutral, any slight provocations will make it quite mad and, mad Endermen poses a very hazardous threat if ill-equipped. When killed, they have a chance to drop a prized @BLU@Enderpearl@END@. They are provoked by either attacking them, or looking directly at their eyes. For this reason, it is often advised not to look at the heads of Endermen unless you want it to come to you. Endermen possess the ability to teleport to wherever they wish and whenever they want which is what makes them extremely dangerous. However, one major weak point of the Endermen is that it takes damage in rain or contact with @BLU@Water@END@ making it teleport away. They will teleport when damaged from fire, and usually away from the sun to someplace dark underneath the surface (such as caves). Projectiles also have no use as the Endermen teleports right before it hits; @BLU@Potions@END@ nor @BLU@Arrows@END@ will work. Endermen also have the unique ability to pick up certain blocks and move them around. Take extra caution when dealing with Endermen.
guide.vanilla.entry.zombiePigmen=@GLD@Zombie Pigmen@END@ populate the @DRED@Nether@END@ in almost every single possible place. Like other neutral mobs, pigmen are neutral until attacked with one catch; attack one, and you attack all. When just one pigmen is attacked, all nearby pigmen will turn hostile towards the player. This hostility continues until you are far away from them, or you have killed them. Pigmen drop @BLU@Rotten Flesh@END@, and @BLU@Gold Nuggets@END@. They also have a very small chance to drop @BLU@Gold Ingots@END@ and their @BLU@Golden Swords@END@. Similar to all @DRED@Nether@END@ mobs, the pigmen is immune to all @BLU@Fire/Lava@END@ damage. Like other "undead" mobs, the pigmen will take damage from the potion effect, @LPRP@Healing@END@ and @LPRP@Regeneration@END@ and will be healed from @LPRP@Harming@END@ and @LPRP@Poison@END@. Pigmen will occasionally wander through nearby @DRED@Nether Portals@END@ and pop over in the @AQA@Overworld@END@. Pigmen can also spawn if a @GRN@Pig@END@ is struck by lightning. Like all @DRED@Nether@END@ mobs, they take damage from @BLU@Water@END@ and rain, and are also damaged by @BLU@Snowballs@END@.
guide.vanilla.entry.zombies=Brraaaiins! @RED@Zombies@END@ spawn all over the @AQA@Overworld@END@ in areas with a light level of 7 or less. They can also spawn from @BLU@Monster Spawners@END@ or during Sieges. Zombies are the standard, melee, undead mob that is quite easy to dispatch of if moderately equipped; however, they are extremely dangerous in massive hoards. Like other undead mobs, zombies will burn in the daylight. Zombies drop @BLU@Rotten Flesh@END@, and very rarely, they also drop @BLU@Iron Ingots@END@, @BLU@Carrots@END@, and @BLU@Potatoes@END@. Their natural instinct is to attack nearby players or @GRN@Villagers@END@. Zombies will usually prioritize attacking villagers more than players. Zombies can also deal damage through not-so-full blocks such as @BLU@Doors, Glass Panes@END@, and @BLU@Iron Bars@END@. If you're playing on @GLD@Hard@END@ mode, then zombies can and will break down @BLU@Wooden Doors@END@ but not iron ones. Like other undead mobs, they are hurt by the potion effects, @LPRP@Healing@END@ and @LPRP@Regeneration@END@ while being healed by @LPRP@Harming@END@ and @LPRP@Poison@END@. A variant of the zombie, is the @RED@Zombie Villager@END@. These zombie villagers have a small percent chance of spawning alongside normal zombies or when a zombie attacks a villager. Even though they share the exact properties of zombies, zombie villagers can e reverted back into villagers by: Giving them the @LPRP@Weakness@END@ effect (via @BLU@Splash Potion@END@) and feeding it a @BLU@Golden Apple@END@. The resulting villager will still have the weakness debuff however, so be sure it is not near any zombies.
guide.vanilla.entry.skeletons=Clack clack! @BLU@Bones@END@ shake around as the @RED@Skeleton@END@ moves around. The skeleton is a hostile, undead mob that unlike other mobs, uses a @BLU@Bow@END@ with @BLU@Arrows@END@ to attack its enemies. It is quite powerful if you're not well equipped. They spawn all over the @AQA@Overworld@END@ where light levels are 7 or less. They can also spawn from @BLU@Monster Spawners@END@. It drops bones and arrows upon death, and has a very rare chance of dropping its bow as well. Like other undead mobs, it will burn up in the daylight forcing it to seek shelter in shade or @BLU@Water@END@. They will also run away from any nearby @GLD@Wolves@END@ or @GRN@Dogs@END@ as they will be attacked by them. A variant of skeletons is the @RED@Wither Skeleton@END@ found within the @DRED@Nether@END@. These larger, black skeletons carry @BLU@Stone Swords@END@ rather than bows and are melee. They only spawn in @DRED@Nether Fortresses@END@ so you'll have to go hunting for them there. If they hit you, it will give you the @LPRP@Wither@END@ potion effect which slowly eats away at your health (bypassing armor) so be careful when taking on these. Wither skeletons drop @BLU@Coal@END@ and bones. Very rarely, they will drop the prized @BLU@Wither Skulls@END@ (chances can be increased with @LPRP@Looting@END@ on your sword). Like all @DRED@Nether@END@ mobs, they take damage from @BLU@Water@END@ and rain, and are also damaged by @BLU@Snowballs@END@.
guide.vanilla.entry.creepers=Ssssss... This hissing, freezing, fear-inducing sound is the sound of a Minecrafter's worst fears: the @RED@Creeper@END@. The creeper is a white-green mob that, when near a player, will explode causing a decent sized crater formed and (if at point blank range with the player having little protection) will instantly kill the player. Attacking creepers through @BLU@Swords@END@ is tricky since if they explode, they do not drop anything. You have to hit it to knock it back, and back up yourself to prevent it from exploding. They spawn throughout the @AQA@Overworld@END@ on solid blocks with a light level of 7 or less. Creepers drop @BLU@Gunpowder@END@ upon death. This explosion will affect everything around it including other mobs. A variant of creepers is the @RED@@BLD@Charged Creepers@END@. Charged creepers are spawned when lightning hits a nearby creeper. These creepers have the same fuse time, and explode with a blast radius twice as much as a normal creeper. Interestingly however, if killed by a @RED@Skeleton@END@, they will drop a random @BLU@Music Disc@END@. They can also be forced to explode if right-clicked with @BLU@Flint And Steel@END@.
guide.vanilla.entry.slime=@RED@Slimes@END@ are green cubes that like to bounce around the @AQA@Overworld@END@. They only spawn in specific chunks called "slime chunks" below Y-level 40. They will also spawn in  @GRN@Swamp@END@ biomes in light levels of 7 or less between Y-levels of 50-70. Slimes also vary in size. There is the small slime, the medium slime, and the large slime. Whenever one is killed, it will split into 2 or more of the smaller ones. Small slimes drop @BLU@Slimeballs@END@ used for @BLU@Sticky Pistons@END@. Even though the large slimes are quite dangerous, the small slimes cannot do any damage as they are so small. A variant of slimes are the @RED@Magma Cubes@END@ These dark red, magma colored cubes are found only in the @DRED@Nether@END@ at any light level. When killed, they have a chance to drop @BLU@Magma Cream@END@. Like all @DRED@Nether@END@ mobs, they take damage from @BLU@Water@END@ and rain, and are also damaged by @BLU@Snowballs@END@ and are immune to @BLU@Fire@END@/@BLU@Lava@END@.
guide.vanilla.entry.witches=@RED@Witches@END@ cackle in their mad concoctions as they brew more potions in their solitary huts. Resembling @GRN@Villagers@END@, witches spawn throughout the @AQA@Overworld@END@ with light levels of 7 or less (also see: Witch Huts). Witches are nasty mobs that use @BLU@Splash Potions@END@ (usually @LPRP@Poison@END@ or @LPRP@Harming@END@) to attack their enemies. They may also use @BLU@Potions@END@ to heal themselves. When killed, witches drop @BLU@Glass Bottles, Glowstone Dust, Gunpowder, Redstone, Spider Eyes, Sugar@END@, and @BLU@Sticks@END@. They may also drop their current potion that they hold when they die. It should be noted that when villagers are struck by lightning, they will turn into witches.
guide.vanilla.entry.silverfish=Silverwha? @RED@Silverfish@END@ are snivelling, little, white bug-like creatures that are only found near Strongholds or @GRN@Extreme Hills@END@ biomes. They spawn unusually compared to all other mobs. They are found within @BLU@Monster Eggs@END@ which are blocks that mimic other blocks. However when broken, it will spawn a silverfish that will try and attack you. Any silverfish lying around can also burrow into nearby blocks turning them into monster eggs. Small groups of silverfish can be quite deadly; even though they only do half a heart of damage, when one is hurt, they can "call" nearby silverfish to come out and attack you essentially creating a swarm. They have the ability to see through walls, and will pathfind until they reach you.
guide.vanilla.entry.blazingGhasts=The @DRED@Nether@END@ wouldn't be such a dangerous place to be if it weren't for these two mobs: the @RED@Blaze@END@ and the @RED@Ghast@END@. Blazes are found in @DRED@Nether Fortresses@END@ where they spawn (light levels of 11 or less) or are spawned from @BLU@Monster Spawners@END@ in the fort and fly around. Upon seeing a player, they will "ignite" or get angry. Once they're angry, they will shoot fireballs (in bursts of 3) at the player. Blazes drop @BLU@Blaze Rods@END@ when they are killed. Ghasts on the other hand, are large, white creatures that spawn all over the @DRED@Nether@END@ at any light level. Once they spot a player, they will start shooting @BLU@Fire Charges@END@ that explode on contact. These fire charges however, can be deflected (although don't count on it) by hitting them with a @BLU@Sword@END@. When killed, they will drop @BLU@Gunpowder@END@ and sometimes a @BLU@Ghast Tear@END@. Like all @DRED@Nether@END@ mobs, they take damage from @BLU@Water@END@ and rain, and are also damaged by @BLU@Snowballs@END@ while being immune to @BLU@Fire@END@/@BLU@Lava@END@.
guide.vanilla.entry.golems=Golems are utility mobs meaning that they will not directly help you, but do other tasks. @DBLU@Iron Golems@END@ are large, and strong mobs that protect @GRN@Villagers@END@ by killing nearby hostile mobs. They will only spawn in villages if certain conditions are met. Otherwise, they can be spawned in a pattern similar to this:
guide.vanilla.entry.golems2=As you can see, the structure needed to build them are fairly straight-forwards. @DBLU@Snow Golems@END@ are golems that don't do much but tread @BLU@Snow@END@ wherever they go. They throw @BLU@Snowballs@END@ at any hostile mobs nearby provoking them but not doing any damage (except to @RED@Blazes@END@). However, snow golems rae quite fragile as they will melt in any hot biomes, if they're in contact with rain or @BLU@Water@END@, or if they're on fire. Both can be tied up with a @BLU@Lead@END@ and leashed to a @BLU@Fence@END@. It is important to also note that iron golems will become hostile if provoked by anything including you.
guide.vanilla.entry.enderDragon=@PRP@The End@END@ is completely filled with @GLD@Endermen@END@ who call the floating islands their home over watched by massive @BLU@Obsidian@END@ towers simingly linking to a flying beast soaring through the dark skies. That beast is called the @PRP@@BLD@@UND@Ender Dragon@END@. The @PRP@@BLD@@UND@Ender Dragon@END@ or the "Queen of the End" as it is sometimes referred to as is a giant boss that blocks the passage out. Notice the beams coming from the towers? Those are coming from the @BLU@Ender Crystals@END@ that rest on top of the towers. The beam is where the @PRP@@BLD@@UND@Ender Dragon@END@ receives its power. As long as it is connected to one of these Ender Crystals, the @PRP@@BLD@@UND@Ender Dragon@END@ will heal quite rapidly. Your first goal would be to destroy them, but how? Punching them will make them explode but it will do the job, so you have to shimmy your way to each and every tower to punch the crystals? No! There's an easier way if you just use a @BLU@Bow@END@ and some @BLU@Arrows@END@. Shooting them with arrows will make them explode as well. But all the while, the @PRP@@BLD@@UND@Ender Dragon@END@ is swooping overhead eyeing you carefully. Sometimes, it may even go for a dive and tear through the surface in an attempt to hit you. Her attacks are very powerful, and she will burrow through any blocks obstructing her. Taking down the @PRP@@BLD@@UND@Ender Dragon@END@ consists of much usage with your bow although there are a few tricks. Throwing @BLU@Eggs@END@ or @BLU@Snowballs@END@ at her head will cause her to stumble for a few moments. Sleeping in a @BLU@Bed@END@ in the End will cause it to explode; you can use this to your advantage by placing them down right before she dives for you and then use them to blow her up. When the @PRP@@BLD@@UND@Ender Dragon@END@ dies, it will disintigrate in the air and drop A LOT and I mean A LOT of @GRN@EXP@END@. She will also create the portal out underneath her dying spot with a little trophy on top; the @BLU@Dragon Egg@END@. You can't use this for anything but decoration, but it's a reward worth having. To get it off, you must use a @BLU@Piston@END@ to push it off. Now, you can jump into the portal and watch victoriously as the End Credits roll past. Congratulations on making it to the End and surviving!
guide.vanilla.entry.witherBoss=The @DGRY@Wither@END@ is a 3-headed, flying, black boss that shoots heads as projectiles. The heads explode on contact with blocks and entities and give the potion effect @LPRP@Withering@END@ which slowly eats away at an entity's health. It is important to have some form of regeneration during this boss battle such as @BLU@Potions@END@ and lots of @BLU@Food@END@. It is spawned using 4 blocks of @BLU@Soul Sand@END@ and 3 @BLU@Wither Skulls@END@ obtainable from @RED@Wither Skeletons@END@ in this pattern:
guide.vanilla.entry.witherBoss2=As soon as it spawns, it will be in a temporary state of regeneration where you cannot do anything and it can't do anything. After it's done regenerating, it will explode in a large radius and start flying around shooting at entities and you (now's the time for that strength potion and that @BLU@Golden Apple@END@ of yours). I would highly suggest getting a decent @BLU@Bow@END@ and use that to slowly whittle down the @DGRY@Wither@END@'s health. Midway through the battle, a light-blue aura effect will appear over the @DGRY@Wither@END@. This is a shield effectively making all projectiles heading for the @DGRY@Wither@END@ useless, bouncing them back at the sender. You'll have to switch to your @BLU@Sword@END@ for the final part of the battle. If blocks are in the @DGRY@Wither@END@'s way, then it will literally "chew" through those blocks to get to the target. After you've dispatched of it, you can successfully claim the @BLU@Nether Star@END@ for yourself!

guide.vanilla.entry.biomes=@GRN@Biomes@END@ are the classifications of different environmental/geographical regions found throughout the world. Each one holds a different climate/weather than the other ones making them unique. Biomes can be roughly split into 4 categories: Snow-covered, cold, medium/lush, and dry/warm (and a neutral). The following Biome entries will give a rough description of the biome, what can be found, etc. Note: All images are from the Minecraft Wiki.
guide.vanilla.entry.snowCoveredBiomes=Snow-Covered biomes are biomes that are covered in snow (hence the name) and instead of raining, snow. When it is snowing, any opaque blocks that don't already have @BLU@Snow@END@ on them will develop a thin layer of snow. Neutral biomes are biomes that are usually covered in @BLU@Water@END@ with an aqua-green @BLU@Grass@END@ shade.
guide.vanilla.entry.hills=There are many more biomes that are considered to be neutral that are called "Hills". However, they spawn in relation to other biomes (there are Taiga Hills, and Forest Hills) each one having the respective propertes of that biome, only the elevation is taller.
guide.vanilla.entry.coldBiomes=Cold Biomes are biomes that have cold features such as high elevation. The biomes snow at a certain height but rains underneath and an aqua-green @BLU@Grass@END@ shade.
guide.vanilla.entry.mediumLushBiomes=Medium/Lush Biomes are biomes that have rain with a vibrant green @BLU@Grass@END@ shade.
guide.vanilla.entry.dryWarmBiomes=Dry/Warm Biomes are biomes that have no rain or snow with an olive @BLU@Grass@END@ color.
guide.vanilla.entry.structures=World-Gen means world generation, and basically covers everything that is generated when the world is loaded. What we'll be looking at will be the structures; anything that's not of natural terrain generation including buildings, and Dungeons. There are many different types of artificial structures in Vanilla Minecraft such as: Dungeons, Abandoned Mineshafts, Strongholds, and NPC Villages (a few others). These structures spawn randomly throughout the world and are target areas for the player to investigate and explore in. In the next few chapters, more information and detail will go into explaining what everything is.
guide.vanilla.entry.dungeons=Dungeons are cube structures found within the @AQA@Overworld@END@ that are walled with @BLU@Cobblestone@END@ and @BLU@Mossy Cobblestone@END@. In the center, they contain a @BLU@Mob Spawner@END@ and on the sides near the walls, it has @BLU@Chests@END@ with items known as 'Dungeon Loot' inside. Since they have a Mobs Spawner spawning mobs, it is best advised to dispatch of them, and light up the area near the spawner to prevent any mobs from spawning to then claim your dungeon loot. Dungeon loot is also where only certain items are found in. For example, @BLU@Saddles, Horse Armor@END@ and @BLU@Name Tags@END@ only come from dungeons so it would be beneficial to stop by one. Dungeons also have variants such as the Jungle Temple and the Desert Temple. These two have different structures and are found in their respective biomes, but contain dungeon loot nonetheless. However, these temples have their own dangers. The Jungle Temple is rigged with a @BLU@Tripwire@END@ hooked up to a @BLU@Dispenser@END@ filled with @BLU@Arrows@END@ -be careful not to trigger it. The Desert Temple is booby trapped with a @BLU@Pressure Plate@END@ with @BLU@TNT@END@ underneath near the chests. Don't step on the pressure plate if you don't want your loot blown up. Happy spelunking! Images courtesy of the Minecraft Wiki
guide.vanilla.entry.mineshafts=Mineshafts are long, complex tunnel networks buried deep and forgotten mining shafts in the @AQA@Overworld@END@. Apart from revealing a lot of @BLU@Ore@END@ in its walls, Mineshafts also contain @BLU@Chest Minecarts@END@ which often contain dungeon loot. Often times, you can find @GLD@Cave Spider@END@ spawners buried in a tangled mess of @BLU@Cobwebs@END@. At this light level, they are hostile and will attack you on sight (don't forget they can also bypass cobwebs) so be wary. Apart from having a lot of @BLU@Rails@END@, there isn't much else in these Mineshafts unless you're searching for ore. Sometimes, Mineshafts do cut into other world-gen structures such as ravines, caves, or even dungeons, so it's worth exploring them.
guide.vanilla.entry.witchHut=Witch Huts are little wooden huts that spawn in @GRN@Swamp@END@ biomes. @RED@Witches@END@ don't actually spawn in them ironically; but they can if certain conditions are met. They spawn in a 7x9x5 area that is the witch hut with light levels of 7 or less. Maybe you could re-purpose the useless structure to be quite of use to you by constructing a witch farm in its place.
guide.vanilla.entry.villages=Villages are a fairly large collection of houses and farms with @GRN@Villagers@END@ inhabiting the village. Villages are only found in the @GRN@Plains, Desert@END@ biome and the @GRN@Savanna@END@ biomes. Villages may also spawn @DBLU@Iron Golems@END@ if the right conditions are met. There are multiple structures that comprise of a village: Huts which are basic, small wooden houses; Small Houses which are larger wooden houses, Large Houses which are even larger wooden houses, Butcher Shops which are the housings for a Butcher villager; Libraries which are the housings for the Librarian villagers (contains @BLU@Bookshelves@END@); Small Farms which grow plants varying from @BLU@Wheat, Carrots@END@, or @BLU@Potatoes@END@; Large Farms which are larger farms; Blacksmith which is a little inlet with @BLU@Furnaces@END@ and @BLU@Lava@END@ and a @BLU@Chest@END@ containing dungeon loot; and Churches which are tall @BLU@Cobblestone@END@ structures that house the Priest villagers. You can trade with the villagers inside the village.
guide.vanilla.entry.strongholds=Strongholds are large, @BLU@Stone Brick@END@ structures that spawn underground in the @AQA@Overworld@END@. Only 3 spawn per world. Strongholds are important because they contain @BLU@End Portals@END@ which lead to @PRP@@UND@@BLD@The End@END@. Locating strongholds however, may not be the easiest thing in the world to do. The most foolproof method (and intended) is to use @BLU@Eyes Of Ender@END@. Simply right-click one in the air, and it will float upwards towards the direction (relative to where you're standing) towards the nearest stronghold. However, eyes of ender may occasionally break when thrown. Otherwise, they will drop down to be reused again. Once you're directly above the stronghold, the ender eye will burrow into the ground instead of going up into the sky. This means that you're above the portal room. Dig down until you hit @BLU@Stone Bricks@END@ (or mossy ones) which signifies that you're standing on top of the portal room's roof. Break through that and you should be in the portal room. To activate the portal, refer to The End entry within Doing Everything. Apart from the portal room, strongholds also contain a vast network of tunnels often intersecting with many ravines and caves. A library also generates with the stronghold signified by the masses of @BLU@Bookshelves@END@ found within one room. Strongholds also generate with @BLU@Chests@END@ containing dungeon loot within them so it's advised to go around exploring. Be careful however, almost none of the stronghold is lit up so the area will be filled with monsters.
guide.vanilla.entry.netherFortresses=@DRED@Nether Fortresses@END@ are forts that spawn within the @DRED@Nether@END@ often above @BLU@Lava@END@ seas. These massive forts are made purely out of @BLU@Nether Brick@END@ and contain several things that a player will need. First, it contains @BLU@Nether Wart@END@ which will be found growing on @BLU@Soul Sand@END@ next to stairs within forts. Nether wart is essential to potion making so make sure to grab a handful of it. Another thing, or rather, entity you should keep an eye out for are @RED@Blazes@END@. They can spawn in the forts but your best bet is to go and find some @BLU@Blaze Spawners@END@ for an endless supply of @BLU@Blaze Rods@END@. The last thing that these forts will be of primary use are the @RED@Wither Skeletons@END@. They spawn throughout the forts under low light levels, but they're still rare. Hunting these down will give you a chance at getting @BLU@Wither Skulls@END@. While you're hunting, you might run into a couple of @BLU@Chests@END@. These chests contain rather good dungeon loot so it's worth taking a look inside.
